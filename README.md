What I Attempted Built a GUI interface with buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /).



Implemented a display area to show input and results

Created custom functions to handle button clicks and calculations

Added error handling for division by zero

Included a clear button to reset the calculator



What Worked Well 


The basic calculator functionality works perfectly (addition, subtraction, multiplication)

The GUI layout is clean and intuitive

Error handling prevents crashes from invalid operations

The display updates correctly during calculations

The clear button resets the calculator properly



Challenges Faced 



Initially had issues with operator precedence in calculations
Took some time to get the grid layout spacing right

Had to research how to properly handle decimal operations

Division by zero initially caused crashes before I implemented error handling

What I Learned How to structure a Tkinter application



Event handling in GUI applications

The importance of input validation

How to manage widget layouts with grid()

Basic state management in a calculator app

Future Improvements 



Add more advanced operations (square root, exponents)

Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR)

Add a history feature to see past calculations

Improve the visual design with custom styling
